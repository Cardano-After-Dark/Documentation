# Cardano After Dark

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** 100+ million poker players are playing on centralised Poker-platforms which are holding their money and are charging high fees
{% endhint %}

Cardano After Dark is a decentralized poker platform, where players can play for cryptocurrencies directly from their wallets with minimum fees.

Cardano After Dark Poker Dapp will give Poker-players a decentralized alternative to play on the Cardano network. In addition, this would be a creative experiment in terms of implementing real-world solutions tackling common DeFi problems with a different approach. For instance:

> * secure protocols without trusted intermediaries (ZK)
> * financial rewards and penalties enforcements (following rules)
> * disaster-prevention rules (responsible gambling)
> * responsible tokenomics (part of the income shall be destined to addiction prevention)
